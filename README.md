# Project Euler in Rust

My first steps in Rust. I wanted to learn a bit about Rust, and chose to solve a few [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems while on vacation.

My main goal was to have fun in Rust. I had very limited time, so as soon as I got a correct answer, I moved on to the next problem.

Disclaimers:
* The code is not of production quality
* On a couple occasions I preferred to explore the language more, rather than seek a more optimal solution
* I don't expect this code to be useful to anybody

Observations:
* On many occasions I got a correct answer as soon as the code compiles. This is in contrast with Python, in which a lot of silly issues are only discovered later in runtime
* I find documentation around Rust to be good, but not perfect - but I'm very biased as a beginner
* I found it silly that I cannot easily import packages without settings up a Cargo project
* I certainly didn't touch on many interesting big topics like multithreading, reference counting, generics, macros. I have seen C++ projects get swamped here and am now wondering if there are fresh ideas I can learn from Rust that can be applied to middle-sized C++ projects
